# Steam Multiplayer
Thanks to the wonderful library of Sh0wdown called RedirectPlay, it is possible to play Stronghold Crusader via Steam!

## Usage

2. Select Multiplayer in the main menu of the game.
3. Choose Steamworks as the provider.

4. Either click Host or Join. When you click Host, a pop-up will appear to configure the lobby. Make sure to set it to Public (not Friends only), and add a password if you want to play only with people you know. When clicking Join, and selecting a lobby, a password pop-up may appear if the lobby has a password set.

## Known issues
1. People joining a public lobby without a password may crash an ongoing game.
2. The pop-up window may be hidden behind the game window, requiring alt+tab to see it.
